# League Config

Managing configuration settings for League of Legends can be a frustrating and time-consuming task, especially when juggling multiple accounts or frequently reinstalling the game. Saving the config files here will make sure all my accounts remains synced.

## Usage
Copypaste the files in `/config` into `C:\Riot Games\League of Legends\Config` and overwrite the content of the files. Make backup copies if you want.
